In this project, I worked with .NET MVC to develop the admin panel. My mentor recommended using MSSQL for the database, and I implemented HTML, CSS, and various JavaScript libraries for the front-end.

As this was my first project, I believe I could approach it more efficiently today with the knowledge Iâ€™ve gained.

What I learned: Effectively using controllers, models, and views within the MVC architecture; designing databases; and working with JavaScript libraries like Dropzone.js for enhanced front-end functionality.
